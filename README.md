In this SQL project, I queried an entertainment database to extract essential information. 
From identifying actors with specific names to analyzing rental patterns and exploring film categories, the queries offer a comprehensive analysis of the store's data.

The code utilizes common table expressions (CTEs) and joins to extract meaningful insights from the database, such as actor statistics, film availability, due dates, customer information, and more. It's a comprehensive set of queries covering various aspects of the database.
